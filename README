Ironclad WPF is a small library with useful stuff for developing
Windows Presentation Foundation applications using Iron Ruby.


INotifyPropertyChanged: 

If you are using the Model-View-View Model pattern you probably know how
annoying it is to bave to raise the PropertyChanged event for all your view
model properties that are used for databinding. This problem is solved by
Ironclad WPF through the module NotifyPropertyChanged. Now all you have to do
to get INotifyPropertyChanged support in your view model is to include this
module and define property_changed_accessor just as you would have done with
ordinary attr_accessors.

The example directory contains a small sample MVVM application that uses the
notify property changed module.
